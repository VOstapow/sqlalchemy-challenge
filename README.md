# Module 10 Challenge
Advanced SQL, SQLAlchemy, ORM

## Background
Finally! I am treating myself to a long holiday vacation in Honolulu, Hawaii. To help with my trip planning, I decided to do a climate analysis about the area. The following sections outline the steps that I took to accomplish this task.
This challenge has the following sections:
### Part 1: Analyze and Explore the Climate Data
In this section, I used Python and SQLAlchemy to do a basic climate analysis and data exploration of the climate database. Specifically, I used SQLAlchemy ORM queries, Pandas, and Matplotlib.
### Part 2: Design Your Climate App
After I completed my initial analysis, I designed a Flask API based on the queries that I developed.

## Data Sources
We worked with the data provided on the six starter files: 
department.csv, dept_emp.csv, dept_manager.csv, employees.csv, salaries.csv, titles.csv

## Software
Microsoft Excel to inspect the data, Jupyter Notebook, pgAdmin 4, https://app.quickdatabasediagrams.com/#/

## Summary
This challenge allowed us to practice Data Modeling, Data Engineering, importing and Data Analysis in PostgreSQL.
Most definitely, I will not be traveling to the location of station USC00519281. Too much rain!
